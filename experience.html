      <h1>My <span class="hover-Exp">Experience</span>!</h1>
      <p>In search of increasing production stream efficiency, I was taken on
        board by the Director of Engineering and Director of Global Affairs at
        the Canadian headquarters of Savaria Inc. The goal for me over this
        project was to understand and analyze the production stream of all 25+
        global products and provide a solution that will enhance the tracking of
        employees and the production line.
      </p>

        <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:0.4em;" class="card1">
          <div class="container1">
            <h3><b>ðŸ’¼ V1504 Developed Programs</b></h3>
            <p style="font-size: 1.0em">
              In this repository, you will find all the programs I have generated
              for global Savaria products. These programs run on their internal
              server to associate my specified manufacturing time to each product.
            </p>

        </div>
      </a>


      <p>
        To do so, after acquiring knowledge
        of each and every little component of all products, I was to slot an
        average manufacturing time to each and develop programs in Savariaâ€™s
        internal system that would now showcase the time required to be taken
        by workers on the assembly when checked in the local server.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through my knowledge of C and OOP, learning the internal systems
        syntax was not a difficult job. I was able to provide enhancements
        to production systems through my skill as a software developer while
        simultaneously incorporated in a business environment.
